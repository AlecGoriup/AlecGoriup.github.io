        <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
        <p>On this website you will have access to some of my favorite projects that I have worked on in the past.
            You may navigate to the projects page by clicking on "projects" in the top left corner from the navigation
            bar. You will also find an about page where I briefly describe who I am, where I am from, and how I got to know 
            computer science in the first place. You may navigate to the about page from the navigation bar at the top of 
            page. Hope you enjoy exploring this website.
